title: Programming - A Dump Child Approach
---

**Credits:** [Quora](http://www.quora.com/How-can-programmers-conceive-and-write-abstract-things-like-computer-programs-and-codes)

**Programming** is the art of instructing a really-really-really dumb kid. You have to be specific. You have to be detailed. Most of all, you need to be concise.

Take "do the laundry" for instance. This is probably quite intuitive for most people. The instruction for a smart kid might be:

* Bring your clothes to the washer and do your laundry.

For a really dumb kid (computer), you need to be much more specific and make sure you cover all your bases.

1.	Go to your room.
2.	Obtain a basket.
3.	For all dirty clothes, place in basket.
4.	Pick up the basket.
5.	Go to the laundry room.
6.	Place dirty clothes in washer.
7.	Add detergent.
8.	Set washer to 45mins, warm.
9.	Push the start button.

This is actually still quite high-level (not detailed enough). You need to include checks in the middle.

During each step, check:    
* is the house on fire?    
* is your name being called?    
* is there a poisonous spider?     

Each one of these need further instructions!!!

That's basically what programming is, a set of very very detailed instructions pieced together in an over all set of instructions we call software.

In this context, it's actually much more amazing what we can do as humans!

Take the first instruction for example:

Go to your room.

This is actually a collection of many subroutines that are built into our brains.

We must have previously learned:

How to move foot muscles
How to move leg muscles
How to detect a difference in center of gravity
How to coordinate a walking sequence between multiple muscle systems, when to pull / relax, and at what timing...
How to re-adjust your balance
How to identify objects in your way.
How to walk around objects
How to identify your room
How to identify a basket
How to identify a spider!!
And so on, and so forth.

Programming is like this. Except we have many programmers from around the world building many-many subroutines.

We share these subroutines so that we can load them into our dumb-dumb children (computers) and make them smart.

In a sense, we can pick what type of pre-trained child we want. A starting foundation that we can build on.

Some prefer raw clay, some prefer a strong foundation.

Culturally, many programming parents love open source projects. There's a feeling of unity and sharing. They are contributing to a global effort in raising the average intelligence of software everywhere.


Happy Programming. <3
