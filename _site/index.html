        Competitive programming tips from Anudeep
      </a>
    </h2>
    <span class="post-date">19 Mar 2015</span>
    <!-- <p>Below are the talk given by Anudeep - <a href="https://abhijournal.wordpress.com/2013/12/22/competitive-programming-what-was-anudeep-nekkantis-competitive-programming-strategy-to-become-35th-in-global-ranking-in-just-6-7-months/">source for reference:</a>:</p>

<h3>What I did ?</h3>

<p>Solved about 300 problems on SPOJ in this order – Sphere Online Judge (SPOJ)</p>

<h3>Result ?</h3>

<p>Became very good with C++ and STL
Got introduced to most Competitive programming KEYWORDS (like DP, maxflow, sets, hashing, etc)
Learned Standard Problems and Algorithms
Intending code
Fast typing :P</p>

<h4>How ?</h4>

<p>Before starting programming, I searched about how and where to start, many said “Learn an Algorithm, implement it, solve  problems related to it”. I did notdo it that way, If you know what algorithm to use you generally think in that direction and leave about correctness.  I did them problem by problem, easy to hard, I spent 1 – 4 hours on a problem.
I get the idea, I code it, Get it Accepted. (I used to test a lot, I always wanted to get AC on first go)</p>

<p>I do not get the idea, I save that problem and try it after a month again. If I still do not get them, then search for hints. If it clearly needed some algorithm which I never used then I first smile (? I could not only because I did not knew the algorithm :P ) and then start reading about that algorithm. TopCoder had tutorials of almost all common algorithms. This is where I did a BIG MISTAKE. I never cared about correctness or run-time analysis proof, I always learned how to solve the problem using that algorithm, I hardly learned about how the algorithm works. I feel bad about it now, but that is how I solved those problems then. I solved max-flow, convex hull, etc., problems using described algorithms but I did not UNDERSTAND those algorithms then.</p>

<p><strong>Mistake:</strong> Once I started taking part in contests, I completely stopped practice.</p>

<p>35th in Global Ranking</p>

<p>CodeChef long contests are comparatively easy ( Which is good, You can learn a lot), you get a lot of time to think about a problem, search for resources. You only need KEYWORDS to search for similar problems.
I gave a lot of time for each contest. I used to solve 4 easy problems in 2-3 days, then take 5-6 days for other 3 problems.
CodeChef rating system is not good. It is highly Volatile.
If I am to start programming now, I would do it this way</p>

<p>Solve 200 most solved problems on SPOJ, Problem by problem. In 2 months.
(This will teach all standard problems, algorithms and implementation skills)
Solve problems from CodeChef and CodeForces for 2 months.
(This will teach variations, we can read others solutions and learn better ways. Skip easy problems)
Solve problems from TopCoder for 2 months.
(This will teach  Dynamic Programming. Div 1 500p)
Check past ACM ICPC Regional’s Problems
(Great quality problems)
If I am to learn a new Algorithm now, I would do it this way</p>

<p>Read it from at least 3-4 different sources.
Understand correctness proof and run-time analysis.
(This is very very important, you will know it only when you  deal with non standard  and hard problems)
Question yourself on every step for correctness. Try to tweak the implementation.
Check other implementations.
Final Note
Thought I became good in solving problems and had good rank. I later(Feb 13) realized that I learned it the wrong way. I then started learning again. I learned all the algorithms again this time gave importance to the algorithm itself, correctness proof and mathematical analysis. It is worth the time.</p>

<p>Lucy and the Flowers – Problem from December long contest, Try to solve it with suffix arrays. You can only if you understand suffix arrays and LCP completely.</p>

<p>I was able to solve a not-so-obvious medium level Max-Flow problem at ACM KGP Onsite only because I completely understood how the algorithm works. It was at 4 hour 25 minutes I got 5th problem accepted, then I read this problem and got it accepted 4 minutes before end. Learning the algorithm helped.</p>

<h4>ANALYSIS:</h4>

<p><strong>Why is this working??</strong>
let k be the num of steps from head to loopBeginNode.<br>
let s be the num of steps from loopBeginNode to Meeting node<br>
<em>slow</em> has previously travelled k + s nodes<br>
<em>fast</em> been circulating the n circles in the ring (1 &lt;= n).<br>
let r be the loop length<br>
then fast has travelled s + nr to meet the slow.<br>
Hence meeting point = <strong>(s + nr) = s</strong> { due to the loop }<br>
The total movement of fast from head is <strong>k + s + nr</strong>.<br>
so from meeting node fast needs to move k times to reach loopBeginNode.<br>
from head, k steps is needed to reach the loopBeginNode.          </p>

<p>Hope you enjoyed it. </p>

<p>Happy Coding . :)</p>

        Stock Market Volatility with Mapreduce
      </a>
    </h2>
    <span class="post-date">28 Feb 2015</span>
    <!-- <p>Using mapreduce to compute the stock market volatility of 3000 stocks with their past three year data.
* <a href="https://github.com/prakashn27/Volatility-Analysis">Code repo Link</a>.</p>

<h2>Algorithm</h2>

<p><strong>Technology</strong>  : Java<br>
<strong>Paradigm</strong>    : MapReduce with Hadoop</p>

<h3>Objective:</h3>

<ul>
<li> Find the top 10 stocks with Lowest (min) volatility.</li>
<li> Find the top 10 stocks with the Highest (max) volatility.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Algorithm</h3>

<p>I used mapreduce paradigm of Hadoop to serialise the calculation of volatility for each month and computed the top 10 and bottom values.<br>
Number of Mapper Implementation : 3 Number of Reducer Implementation : 3        </p>

<h4>Roles of each Mapper and Reducer:</h4>

<p><strong>Mapper1</strong><br>
• splits the input data and options the date and close adjacent value.
• key - stock_name + month + year
• value - date + adjacent close value<br>
<strong>Reducer1</strong><br>
• Since after the map step the values which have same key are grouped
together and passed to the reducer as iterable, values that correspond to specific month and year of the particular stock are grouped together.
• Beginning adjacent close value and end adjacent close value are obtained by integrating through the iterable and the value of xi for the corresponding month is computed.
• key - Company Name
• Value - Computed Xi.<br>
<strong>Mapper2</strong><br>
• Now we have to consolidate all the values obtained from the reducer with respect to company name.
• Key - Company Name
• Value - Xi<br>
<strong>Reducer2</strong><br>
• All the xi corresponding to the the respective companies are grouped
together.
• Volatility for the particular company is obtained from these values.
• Key - Company Name
• Value - Volatility<br>
<strong>Mapper3:</strong><br>
• All the companies are grouped together with a common key.
• Key - Common
• Value = Company Name + Volatility
<strong>Reducer3:</strong><br>
• Obtained iterable contains all the company name with values and they are
sorted by a custom comparator.
• top 10 and bottom 10 values are obtained from the List</p>
